# アクセス制御と認証のテスト (Testing Access Control and Authentication Vulnerabilties)

### **説明**

Improper access control is a critical security vulnerability in smart contracts that occurs when unauthorized users can access or modify sensitive functions or data. This issue typically arises when the code does not enforce strict access restrictions based on user permissions.

Access control vulnerabilities are especially significant in scenarios involving governance or critical operations, such as:

- Minting tokens
- Voting on proposals
- Withdrawing funds
- Pausing or upgrading contracts
- Changing contract ownership

### **例: 適切なアクセス制御のないコード**


```solidity
function burn(address account, uint256 amount) public 
{
    // No access control is implemented for the burn function
    _burn(account, amount); 
}
```
### **影響**

- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to critical functions and data within the contract, compromising its integrity and security.
- Vulnerabilities can lead to the theft of funds or assets controlled by the contract, causing significant financial damage to users and stakeholders.


### **対策**


- Ensure initialization functions can only be called once and exclusively by authorized entities.
- Use established access control patterns like Ownable or RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in your contracts to manage permissions and ensure that only authorized users can access certain functions. This can be done by adding appropriate access control modifiers, such as onlyOwner or custom roles to sensitive functions.

## マルチ署名スキームのテスト (Testing Multi-Signature Schemes)


Ensure that multi-signature schemes are implemented for critical operations, requiring approvals from multiple authorized parties to enhance security and reduce the risk of unauthorized actions.

- Verify that the multi-signature logic ensures a configurable threshold of approvals before executing sensitive operations.  
- Confirm that all signers are authenticated and that duplicate signatures are rejected.  
- Test edge cases, such as insufficient approvals or tampered data.

```solidity
// Example of multi-signature scheme
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MultiSigWallet {
    address[] public owners;
    uint public requiredApprovals;
    mapping(address => bool) public isOwner;
    mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) public approvals;

    struct Transaction {
        address to;
        uint value;
        bool executed;
    }

    Transaction[] public transactions;

    constructor(address[] memory _owners, uint _requiredApprovals) {
        require(_owners.length > 0, "Owners required");
        require(_requiredApprovals > 0 && _requiredApprovals <= _owners.length, "Invalid approval count");

        for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; i++) {
            isOwner[_owners[i]] = true;
        }
        owners = _owners;
        requiredApprovals = _requiredApprovals;
    }

    function submitTransaction(address _to, uint _value) public {
        require(isOwner[msg.sender], "Not an owner");
        transactions.push(Transaction({to: _to, value: _value, executed: false}));
    }

    function approveTransaction(uint _txIndex) public {
        require(isOwner[msg.sender], "Not an owner");
        require(!approvals[_txIndex][msg.sender], "Already approved");

        approvals[_txIndex][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function executeTransaction(uint _txIndex) public {
        require(transactions[_txIndex].executed == false, "Already executed");

        uint approvalCount = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            if (approvals[_txIndex][owners[i]]) {
                approvalCount++;
            }
        }

        require(approvalCount >= requiredApprovals, "Not enough approvals");

        transactions[_txIndex].executed = true;
        payable(transactions[_txIndex].to).transfer(transactions[_txIndex].value);
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```
Review the logic to ensure all approvals are validated before execution, duplicate approvals are prevented, and transaction data integrity is maintained. Test with various approval scenarios to verify proper handling of edge cases.

## アイデンティティ検証のテスト (Identity Verification Test)


Validate that unexpected addresses do not result in unintended behaviors, particularly when these addresses refer to contracts within the same protocol.

- Ensure that when interacting with contracts, unexpected addresses are properly validated before performing sensitive operations.
```solidity
require(address(contract) != address(0), "Invalid address");
```

Verify that functions like ecrecover handle all potential null addresses properly to avoid vulnerabilities arising from unexpected ecrecover outputs.

- Ensure that ecrecover does not process empty or null addresses.
```solidity
address recovered = ecrecover(messageHash, v, r, s);
require(recovered != address(0), "Invalid signature");
```

___

## 最小権限の原則のテスト (Least Privilege Principle Test)


Use msg.sender instead of tx.origin for authorization to avoid potential abuse from malicious contracts; include checks like require(tx.origin == msg.sender) to ensure the sender is an EOA.

- tx.origin can be abused by malicious contracts to trick the system into performing actions on behalf of an unsuspecting user. msg.sender is preferred since it refers to the direct sender of the message.
```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
require(tx.origin == msg.sender, "Only EOA can execute");
```

Certain addresses might be blocked or restricted from receiving tokens (e.g., LUSD). Ensure that address restrictions are properly managed and verified.

- If certain addresses (like LUSD) should be blocked from receiving tokens, ensure that there’s a check in place to restrict these addresses.
```solidity
address restrictedAddress = 0x123...;  // Example of a restricted address
require(msg.sender != restrictedAddress, "Restricted address cannot perform this operation");
```


Ensure that Guard’s hooks (e.g., checkTransaction(), checkAfterExecution()) are executed to enforce critical security checks.

- If using a Guard contract, ensure that hooks like checkTransaction() or checkAfterExecution() are properly implemented to enforce security conditions.
```solidity
function checkTransaction() internal {
    // Add conditions to verify transaction before execution
}

function checkAfterExecution() internal {
    // Add conditions to verify transaction after execution
}
```

## 重要な機能でのアクセス制御のテスト (Test Access Control on Critical Functions)


Ensure that access controls are implemented correctly to determine who can use certain functions, and avoid unauthorized changes or withdrawals.

- Ensure that functions requiring specific roles or permissions are restricted properly using onlyOwner or role-based checks.
```solidity
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        // Only the owner can withdraw
    }
```

## 期限付きパーミッションのテスト (Test Timed Permissions)



Ensure that access controls are implemented correctly to determine who can use certain functions, and avoid unauthorized changes or withdrawals.

- Ensure that functions requiring specific roles or permissions are restricted properly using onlyOwner or role-based checks.

```solidity
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
        // Only the owner can withdraw
    }
```

---

## マークルツリーを使用するアクセス制御のテスト (Test Access Control Using Merkle Trees)


Ensure that `msg.sender` validation is properly implemented when using Merkle trees to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access.

- When using Merkle trees to authenticate users or grant permissions, ensure that the contract verifies that `msg.sender` matches the expected address and Merkle proof. This prevents unauthorized actors from bypassing security by submitting incorrect proofs.

```solidity
    require(verifyMerkleProof(msg.sender, merkleProof), "Invalid Merkle proof");
```

- Use whitelisting to restrict interactions to a specific set of addresses, providing additional security against malicious actors.

- Implement a whitelisting mechanism that allows only approved addresses to interact with specific functions. Ensure that only addresses explicitly added to the whitelist are able to execute sensitive operations.

```solidity
    address[] public whitelist;

    modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
        bool isWhitelisted = false;
        for (uint i = 0; i < whitelist.length; i++) {
            if (msg.sender == whitelist[i]) {
                isWhitelisted = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        require(isWhitelisted, "Address not whitelisted");
        _;
    }

    function addToWhitelist(address _address) external onlyOwner {
        whitelist.push(_address);
    }
```
- Ensure that functions modifying the contract state or accessing sensitive operations have proper access controls implemented.

- Critical functions, such as those that modify contract state or handle sensitive information, should only be callable by authorized addresses (e.g., the owner or an admin). Use modifiers to enforce access controls for these functions.

```solidity
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the contract owner");
        _;
    }

    function modifyContractState() external onlyOwner {
        // Logic to modify contract state
    }
```
